Employee Database

implementation of a database of employees, each with a given ID, name, phone No., and salary.
database can be query'd using two methods contained within EmployeeOne.c and EmployeeTwo.c

## EmployeeOne.c
Utilizes multiple search functions (one for each column/data field) that can be called by the main function.

## EmployeeTwo.c
Utilizes virtual functions and passing of functions to abstract the searching algorithm, so that adding future search types is trivial.
